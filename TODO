* EASY:         clean out packages dir, but only if it's the last dist that
                uses that packagedir

* HARD:		make an object class "Root" and execute all operations on this

* EASY:		make mach-helper do rm if the root's rm is gone
* EASY:		add warning about missing stuff from .rpmmacros for signing
* EASY:		check for ending spaces in urlgrab, disallow
* EASY:		sign and collect packages at end of complete build
* EASY:		verify downloaded Sources and Patches for false downloads
* HARD:		figure out a good way to deal with /proc, because it's not safe
                for the host to have this
* KLUDGEY:      SuSE 7.3 and 8.0 setups, the problem is their ncurses package
                which has a %pre script that requires bash.  And bash requires
                libncurses.so.5 :/
* MEDIUM:	If spec file contains %define version ...
                and Version: %{version}, we need to expand this
