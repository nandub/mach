* EASY:		finish build order figuring out by using rpm -q --specfile
* HARD:		figure out how to make sure that the rpm on the host system
                can properly install rpms for the target dist
                suggestion: use rpm2cpio to extract the static rpm binary
* EASY:         clean out packages dir, but only if it's the last dist that
                uses that packagedir
* MEDIUM:       figure out how to get around checking gpg sigs on installing
                just built packages

* MEDIUM:	create a helper binary that does everything mach needs root
                privileges for, including calling special rpm binaries

* HARD:		make an object class "Root" and execute all operations on this

* EASY:		make rootsdir a configure option so it's hardcompiled into
		mach-helper
