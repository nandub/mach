* HARD:		make an object class "Root" and execute all operations on this
* EASY:		add warning about missing stuff from .rpmmacros for signing
* EASY:		check for ending spaces in urlgrab, disallow
* EASY:		sign and collect packages at end of complete build
* EASY:		verify downloaded Sources and Patches for false downloads
* HARD:		figure out a good way to deal with /proc, because it's not safe
                for the host to have this
* KLUDGEY:      SuSE 7.3 and 8.0 setups, the problem is their ncurses package
                which has a %pre script that requires bash.  And bash requires
                libncurses.so.5 :/
* MEDIUM:	rpm -q --specfile shouldn't be used; it fails on %install
                and similar in Changelog entries
* MEDIUM:	make sure we don't rebuild binary rpms :)
* EASY:		allow people to specify an alternate location for a root
* EASY:		bash completion
* MEDIUM:	when installing buildreqs, don't fail on kernel related stuff
		(due to # silliness) but do fail on others
* HARD:		integrate ccache building
* HARD:		integrate distcc support
* EASY:		make proc mounting an option, document the issues with it
* MEDIUM:	allow specification of multiple roots for multibuilding
* MEDIUM:	add e2fs target which makes the root into a filesystem file
* MEDIUM:	make output of rpm and apt-get and friends immediately available
* MEDIUM:	make default buildroot dependant on target distro
* MEDIUM:	figure out what to do with check for release name mangling
                in the fedora.us fedora 1 case where "1" is used as disttag
* MEDIUM:	On FC1, "setup base" for RH 7.2 fails: /lib/libnss_files.so.2:
		symbol _nss_files_parse_grent, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined
		in file libc.so.6 with link time reference
		SuSE 8.1 would need the pam-modules package in "base" but
		installing it fails due to the same relocation error.
* MEDIUM:	"rpm -q --specfile" should be run inside the build root (or
		perhaps using "rpm --root" would suffice) in order to
		properly use distro/root specific macros.
