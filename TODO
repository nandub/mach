* EASY:         clean out packages dir, but only if it's the last dist that
                uses that packagedir

* HARD:		make an object class "Root" and execute all operations on this

* EASY:		make mach-helper do rm if the root's rm is gone
* EASY:		add warning about missing stuff from .rpmmacros for signing
* EASY:		check for ending spaces in urlgrab, disallow
* EASY:		sign and collect packages at end of complete build
* EASY:		verify downloaded Sources and Patches for false downloads
* HARD:		figure out a good way to deal with /proc, because it's not safe
                for the host to have this
* KLUDGEY:      SuSE 7.3 and 8.0 setups, the problem is their ncurses package
                which has a %pre script that requires bash.  And bash requires
                libncurses.so.5 :/
* MEDIUM:	rpm -q --specfile shouldn't be used; it fails on %install
                and similar in Changelog entries
* MEDIUM:	make sure we don't rebuild binary rpms :)
* EASY:		allow people to specify an alternate location for a root
* EASY:		bash completion
* EASY:		unlock root on ctrl-c interrupt
* EASY:		have "quiet" mode so that output is usable for comparison
* HARD:		integrate ccache building
* HARD:		integrate distcc support
* EASY:		make proc mounting an option, document the issues with it
