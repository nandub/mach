2003-06-03  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* scripts/mach.in: fix some places where / was forgotten now that
                           $HOME is set
                           clear RPM::Pre-Install-Pkgs so GPG's aren't checked
	* src/mach-helper.c: (do_command): added HOME env var because fc-cache
                             segfaults if it's not set

2003-06-02  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * scripts/mach.in: added signing and collecting of packages

2003-05-29  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * scripts/mach.in: fix setup not handling arg properly

2003-05-25  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * scripts/mach.in: do proper build ordering by parsing specfiles
                           for their generated results

2003-05-24  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * scripts/mach.in: lots of bugfixes

2003-05-22  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * src/mach-helper.c: created
        * scripts/mach.in: make use of mach-helper

2003-05-21  Thomas Vander Stichele  <set EMAIL_ADDRESS environment variable>

	* etc/Makefile.am: reworked config
	* etc/apt: reworked config
	* etc/conf.in: reworked config
	* etc/packages: reworked config
	* scripts/mach.in: reworked large parts, started objectifying Root,
                           use host's apt and rpm to manipulate root packages

2003-05-13  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * scripts/mach.in:
          use rpm2cpio to extract an rpm matching the target platform
          to install packages with.
          This also uses a nasty chroot hack, so this ought to be thought
          through.

2003-05-12  Ville Skyttä  <ville dot skytta at iki dot fi>

	* scripts/mach.in:
	Don't exit from setup_consistency if the commands succeed :)
	Use the -H argument to sudo for better non-root experience.
	Fix unlock target by introducing a dummy 2nd argument.

	* etc/packages:
	* scripts/mach.in:
	Implement configurable per-distro build packages, and add
	Fedora ones to default packages config.

2003-05-12  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* configure.in:
	* etc/Makefile.am:
	* etc/conf:
	* etc/conf.in: autogenerate conf from conf.in
	* mach.spec.in: make all dirs FHS-compliant
	* scripts/mach.in: make all dirs FHS-compliant

2003-05-12  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* etc/conf: add /usr/bin/apt-sigchecker as generated files, default
                    to letting everything pass
	* scripts/mach.in: add function to regenerate any file in
                           config['files'] and use it for apt-sigchecker

2003-05-12  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

        * add global /bin/bash -c '...' wrapping
        * use LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 for any installing/querying;
          this ought to be configurable somehow

2003-05-11  Ville Skyttä  <ville dot skytta at iki dot fi>

	* Force queryformat for rpm -q, users may have customized formats
	  which will confuse mach.
	* Add (X)Emacs python mode cookies to config files.

2003-05-09  Thomas Vander Stichele <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* added .machrc in home dir parsing

2003-05-09  Ville Skyttä  <ville dot skytta at iki dot fi>

	* Use apt's "rpm-dir" indextype to create a local mini-repo inside the 
	chroot.  This way, we can install the binary packages and their
	dependencies just by doing a "apt-get install foo".
	* Put all URL retrieval operations into a new urlgrab function, which
	tries to preserve timestamps of the downloads.
	* Use shutil.copy2 instead of copy, again for preserving timestamps.
	* Add --clean to rpmbuild --rebuild.

2003-05-09  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* added ASCII spinner themes
	* add more dists and rework config file for it
	* make each root download in a different packages dir

2003-05-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* implemented a progress indicator as output
	* implemented snapshot of "build" target with auto-return to it
	on setup build

2003-04-30  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* rewrite in python
